Hello Doctor,I am John.I've been having chest pain and difficulty breathing when I walk uphill or exert myself. The pain feels like pressure or squeezing in my chest, and it sometimes radiates to my left arm. It usually lasts for a few minutes and goes away when I rest.I have a history of high blood pressure and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes five years ago. I've been taking medications for both conditions as prescribed by my primary care physician.I try to eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly, but lately, I've been struggling to keep up with my exercise routine due to these symptoms. I used to smoke, but I quit ten years ago. I don't drink alcohol excessively, and I try to manage stress through relaxation techniques.My father had a heart attack in his early 60s, and my older brother was diagnosed with coronary artery disease last year. So, there's a family history of heart problems.
These are my recent records on  February 5, 2024:
1.Blood Pressure Readings:
Systolic: 140 mmHg
Diastolic: 85 mmHg
2.Glucose Monitoring Records:
Fasting Blood Glucose: 120 mg/dL
Postprandial Blood Glucose (2 hours after a meal): 160 mg/dL
3.ECG Results:
Sinus rhythm
Normal PR interval (0.12 seconds)
Normal QRS duration (0.08 seconds)
Normal QT interval (0.36 seconds)
No ST segment elevation or depression
No T wave abnormalities
So,Doctor, what could be causing these symptoms? Do you think it's related to my heart condition or could it be something else? What tests do you recommend to diagnose the problem accurately?
